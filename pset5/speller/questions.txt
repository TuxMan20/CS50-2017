Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?
    For precision, not losing the data while another function is loaded.

Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.
    First, as long as the file pointer (fp) is not seeing an "end of file", it will check if the current character is indeed a letter or an apostrophe. If it's a number, or the apostrophe is not within a word
    or the "word" is longer than the limit, it will be ignored and we move the file pointer to the next word.

Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time?
Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
    the function has already ways to move along the stream, protections for errors and returns the char as a standard unsigned char.

Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
    That way we can change the pointer, but not the value we are pointing to (we couldn't have a bug that rewrites the entire text file)
