# Problem set 8: Fullstack Web Development with Javascript

The final problem set. It is here where we take eveything we take everything we have learned so far and put our skills to the test.

### **Mashup**
We have to build a web app where a user can search a US city or Postal Code. It returns a map where he sees recent news articles that have been posted around this part.

From a Flask framework, we import a list of US cities in a SQL Database. We execute queries with Python and SQLAlchemy. It is then returned on the web page where a Javascript program gives city name suggestions in real time to the user, and finally integrates with Google Maps and Google News API to create pins on the map where news articles are found.

Truly a 'Mashup' of everything we need to create a web application
