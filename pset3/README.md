# Problem set 3: Sort and Search Algorithms 

The next problem set 

### **Find**
Introduction and implementation of sorting and searching algorithms to generate a list of random numbers, sort it then attempt to find a certain number.
For this exact project, I used a bubble sort and a binary search.


### **Fifteen**
More complex implementation of 2D arrays to create a puzzle game.
