1.  What’s stdint.h
A C library that defines a collection of Integers that have a definite "width". ie: uin8_t will always be 8 bytes.

2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
It is to ensure a predictable and controlable size of integers independently of processors and hardwares.

3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
BYTE: 1, DWORD: 4 BYTES, LONG: 4 BYTES, WORD: 2 BYTES

4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?
    Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
0x42 0x4D


5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
bfSize is the total FILE SIZE given in bytes, and biSize is the size of the INFO HEADER in bytes. So biSize is always
very small because it is part of the file size. Also, it should more or less stay the same across multiple files.

6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
It means the file is a DIB(Device indepedant bitmap) that starts from the top to the bottom where the origin point is
at the top left. A positive biHeight means the origin is at the BOTTOM left.


7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
it's in the biBitCount

8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
If the file cannot be found

9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
It tries to read ONE element of size RGBTRIPLE (the struct containing the informations for each RGB colors)

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
(4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4 = 3

11. What does fseek do?
changes the current file pointer while working with fopen. You declare the function while telling the program
what file to use it in, of how much to offset the pointer and finally where is the origin.
ex: fseek(myText, 4, SEEK_SET); <-- this will act upon the 4th character in myText begining from SEEK_SET(Begining of
the text)

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
within the implementation of fseek(), this sets the start of fseek at the current file pointer used at the moment.
